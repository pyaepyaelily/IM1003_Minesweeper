NTU IEM assignment and here are the assignment specs:
http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/JavaGame_MineSweeper.html

This is a basic implementation of the MineSweeper game that my Professor has tasked us to do. 

We did it according to his template online and modify it to make it work.

## Additional features

 - Dynamic Game Size
 - Dynamic Difficulty
 - Able to restart when the match ends
 - Able to set new difficulty after match ends

## Read Up if you want to use my code and not be caught by Prof

 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science) (Must understand the concept)
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill (optional)
 - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14077521/recursive-floodfill-overflowing (know that you can't use for-loops in the recursion because it will cause StackOverflow)
 - https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/JOptionPane.html (Mostly just understand the API)

> #### my code is very hastily written so there might be a better and cleaner way of tackling this project!!
> #### Best is to tackle it yourself!!!!
